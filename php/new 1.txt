"Sasha glanced at Alex. He was angry, and the anger made him recognizable in a way that an hour of aimless chatter (mostly hers, it was true) had not: he was new to New York."
Sasha believes that someone caring about a stolen wallet means they come from a smaller town. There is little reason to believe this is actually true.
"It was the sort of frank need that New Yorkers quickly learn how to hide, and Sasha recoiled."
It appears as though New York is a city where you need to act tough to survive.
"We live in a city where people will steal the hair off your head if you give them half a chance, but you leave your stuff lying in plain sight and expect it to be waiting for you when you come back?"
Another indication that this is a tough city. The main character uses the harsh setting she lives in as an excuse to steal the wallet.
"Sasha, who was thirty-five, had passed that point. Still, not even Coz knew her real age."
An example of Sasha acting dishonestly.
"'Someone stole my wallet. My ID is gone, and I have to catch a plane tomorrow morning. I'm just desperate!'"
The author rarely outright states the inflection a person uses when they speak. The reader can figure it out easily based on context.

The narration appears to be colored by Sasha's thoughts and beliefs. According to the narrator, everyone in New York needs to act heartless in order to survive. This reflects Sasha's status as a kleptomaniac. The story follows her, and she uses "New York is a tough place" as an excuse to steal from others. The narrator describes the characters around her as naive, because that is how Sasha sees them. More characterization comes from the narration than the dialogue. Most of the dialogue does not have much emotional depth, it is just the characters describing what they are doing in the situation. If the author wants the reader to see how someone is feeling, he will more often describe it in the narration.
